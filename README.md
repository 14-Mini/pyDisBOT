It is a simple python discord bot that does some mederation with specific roles the user has, searches up some history about any user specific STOCK and recommendations from some experts about that specific STOCK. It also pulls out some news that you request and wiki searches. Additionally there's two more commands like 'rolls' and 'flip' and a Speedtest for your network.

There is also a purge feature added to it, which means you can slect x number of messeges to be instantly deleted by the BOT.
